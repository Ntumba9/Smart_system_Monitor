# Smart_system_Monitor
Smart System Monitor is a hybrid system monitoring platform that collects low-level performance metrics, applies automation rules, and visualizes real-time insights through a web-based dashboard. It is designed to demonstrate strong systems thinking, performance awareness, and clean multi-layer architecture.

Tech Stack & Architecture

C – High-performance system agent for collecting CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics

Python – Automation logic, rule evaluation, logging, and data processing

Java – Service controller and API layer managing system components

HTML / CSS / JavaScript – Web-based dashboard for visualization and control

Each language is used intentionally based on its strengths, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

Key Features

Real-time system metric collection

Rule-based automation and alerts

Historical logging and analytics

Web dashboard with live updates
